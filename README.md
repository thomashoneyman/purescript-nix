# PureScript Nix

An overlay and flake exposing PureScript tools maintained by the core team (ie. the compiler, `purs`, and package manager, `spago`). Tested on the following architectures:

- x86_64-linux
- x86_64-darwin (Intel Mac)
- aarch64-darwin (M1 Mac)

This Nix library also includes helper functions for building PureScript packages, namely:

- `buildSpagoLock`: Discover and build all workspaces and dependencies from a spago.lock file
- `buildPackageLock`: Discover and download dependencies listed in a package-lock.json (:warning: only suitable for simple projects like typical PureScript FFI; for significant applications there are better solutions like npmlock2nix)

There is an example project in the [`example`](./example) directory which demonstrates how to package a PureScript application using multiple Spago workspaces and foreign Node dependencies into an executable via the utilities in this library. Specifically, see the included [`default.nix`](./example/default.nix). You can also see the [`generate`](./generate/) directory for a PureScript script implemented using this library.

## Usage

In a Nix flake, use the provided overlay when importing nixpkgs to get access to tools like `purs` and `spago` and functions like `buildSpagoLock`. For example, the below flake creates a development shell with recent versions of the PureScript compiler and Spago package manager:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.05";
    flake-utils.url  = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    purescript-nix.url = "github:thomashoneyman/purescript-nix";
    purescript-nix.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, purescript-nix }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        overlays = [ purescript-nix.overlays.default ];
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system overlays;
        };
      in {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = [
            pkgs.purs.purs-unstable
            pkgs.spago.spago-0_93_4
          ];
        };
      }
    );
}
```

You can also run individual packages from the flake, e.g.

```console
nix run github:thomashoneyman/purescript-nix#purs-unstable
```

## Development

There is a generation script stored in the [generate](./generate/) directory which will search for new versions of the tools included in this repository and attempt to produce new derivations for them. This script is run in CI nightly, but can also be run manually:

```console
nix run .#generate
```
